# Ataxx
![alt tag](https://github.com/shrobon/Ataxx/blob/master/ataxx.jpg)

This was my first programming assignment for the course MM812-(heuristic Search). 
- The aim of this assignment was to play an Ataxx game optimally, given an nxn(4-to-8) board configuration.
- The current version of the program is based on the Alpha-beta pruning with iterative deepening algorithm.
- It is possible to control the depth of the search.
- There is also a timeout option available, if you wish to restrict the amount of time per move for the AI player. 
- The rules of the game and entire problem description can be found in the file Question.txt
- A brief report about this assignment in AssignmentReport.pdf


## Installation
1. You need to have java installed in your system to run this program.
2. Download the code, cd inside the code directory and type make in your terminal.
3. type the following in your terminal 
```
